        <h1>Build a mag loop antenna</h1>
        <p>
            The magnetic loop antennas have a lot of advantages: they are compact and are pretty efficient.
            So, they are quite relevant when the QRA is in a flat, and also for indoor use. Actually, that's
            my case having the QRA located in a parisian flat. Deploying a full antenna l/4 antenna for HF
            is complex even with a balcony, because the antenna would be in front of my neighbors window.
        </p>

        <h2>Mag loop basics</h2>
        <p>
            The small antennas consist of two loop, an inner one and a outer one. The inner loop is directly connected to the coax,
            an end to the shield, the other one to the core. The inner loop acts like a Faraday loop with the second one. The outer
            loop is not connected to the inner one. Thus the outer loop is inductively fed by the inner one.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the outer loop must be tuned correctly with the help of a capacitor. Because the bandwidth of the antenna is 
            small, the capacitor has to be variable even on the same band!
        </p>

        <h2>Finding the good parameters</h2>
        <p>
            I advise you to use the excellent tool <a href="https://miguelvaca.github.io/vk3cpu/magloop.html">VK3CPU Magloop Antenna Calculator</a>.
            It computes for you all the equation and also gives you the perfect parameters for: efficiency, capacitance, voltage, Q value.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How to proceed?</h3>
        <p>
            First of all, you need to find the parameters &#8960;a and &#8960;b, respectively the diameters of the inner and outer loop. My advise would
            to initially toggle only the efficiency (ratio of energy transmitted to RF with respect to heat) and the Q-value. So, you can find the best
            enough efficiency for your antenna at the desired band, usually, they are pretty compact up to 20m. If you search for a 40m or even a 80m
            mag loop antenna, the only solution will be to add more coils, you can vary it with N.
        </p>
