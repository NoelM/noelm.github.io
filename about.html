            Hello! My name is NoÃ«l and I am a Software Engineer (mostly a manager now) in Paris. My center of interests are: low and retro-tech (arduinos, minitel, esp32, ...),
            but also science (former physicist) and amateur radio (F4JJD).
        </p>
        <p>
            I began the college in Lyon, where I studied physics and chemistry. I discovered there that chemistry wasn't made for me.
            So, I focused within physics only and especially in the theoretical side. I joined in 2013 the CNRS (French organization for research) as a PhD student.
            I worked for three years on the neutron stars physics, until I defended my PhD \o/
        </p>
        <p>
            I moved to software engineering after a year of postdoc at the edge between physics and computer science. I joined in 2017 @QwantResearch, as a CS researcher.
            Most of my work consisted solving problems like: web graph computation over a billion nodes (with limited RAM, but in a human-scale time) and web crawling
            at scale (a billion pages a day). Now and since 2019, I am working @Botify a technical SEO company providing analytics and optimized content to bots.
            There I am leading a team of developers where we build a really-fast cache of webpages, with pre-rendering and SEO-optimization, fully made in Go.
        </p>
